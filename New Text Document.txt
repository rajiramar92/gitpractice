Webdriver driver=new ChromeDriver();

Webdriver is interface ,we cant crate object
so creating object for driver class means ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
Webdriver interface implemented in remote webdriver class but remote web driver 
cant use in local system and can be used in remote system.
so it will be implemented on subclass



//upcasting....convert child to parent
parent a=new child();

parent object will hold the child(assigning to parent)

Webdriver driver=new ChromeChid();

List a=new LinkedList();

//downcasting....convert parent to child
child a=new parent();

assigning to child

child b=(child)a;

TakesScreenShot tk=(TakesScreenshot)driver;(done in this way as we are declaring Webdriver driver=new ChromeDriver();)
